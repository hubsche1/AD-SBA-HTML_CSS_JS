####Description of the planned site:
I have just come up with a wonderful new electronic item, and need to start taking preorders!
This simple site will include a description of the device, preorder registration form, and a contact form.
Images included will be open license (pexels, etc.), and videos/gifs will need to be sourced similarly.
Javascript will be used to store and log data for now, though AJAX or JSON may be explored within the time constraints.
Will also handle mouseover/mouseleave/keyboard events.
