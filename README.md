### Description of the planned site:
I have just come up with a wonderful new electronic item, and need to start taking preorders! This simple site will include a description of the device, preorder registration form, and a contact form. Images included will be open license (pexels, etc.), and videos/gifs will need to be sourced similarly. Javascript will be used to store and log data for now, though AJAX or JSON may be explored within the time constraints. Will also handle mouseover/mouseleave events.

8/22/2020: I am calling this complete until I revisit it to improve it (after submission). There are a number of improvements to make:
- responsive pages. I did not feel comfortable making this one responsive in such a short time, but responsive is really the only way to go.
- I'd like to find a way to handle button click events on different pages in ONE JS script - my scripts would try to handle ALL button clicks in one go, which is... weird. Thanks, javascript.
- my styling is probably too excessive. I almost certainly repeated myself; this is something I need to practice.
- It's a little hard to come up with "reasons" to use some of the JS specified. Perhaps I should have chosen something else, but I am not sure what would have used those well. Perhaps a tutorial site?

Regardless, this site covers most, if not all, of the required deliverables.: many tags, 2 forms, 3 pages, tables, different content (all royalty free!), dropdown, regex, CSS all ways, 2 fonts (one web), variables, loops, arrays/objects, functions, and events.

This was certainly a useful exercise: I have some idea of what I need to do to improve, and I still feel accomplished. Onto the next!
